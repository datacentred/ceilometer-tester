== Launching a billable plan

You'll need to download terraform for this.
https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

With terraform installed, execute this command to create all the resources in your project with your keypair:
-------
/path/to/terraform apply -var 'key_pair=<your-keypair-name>'
-------
This will use `dc1.1x1` as a flavour and `Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS (Xenial)` as a image for instances created by the plan.
You can change the default flavour and image by passing them as variables:
-------
/path/to/terraform apply -var 'flavour_id=f0577618-9125-4948-b450-474e225bbc4c' -var 'image_id=73fb2fff-64bf-415f-82ec-b63bbb04b3cf' -var 'key_pair=<your-keypair-name>'
-------
Substitute `apply` with `destroy` to clean up afterwards.
