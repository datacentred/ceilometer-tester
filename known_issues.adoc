== Problem #1 [3/06/2017] (PARTIALLY FIXED)
Looks like the `limit` parameter causes the client to crash:
-------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "show_billable_resources.py", line 39, in <module>
    main()
  File "show_billable_resources.py", line 30, in main
    print( cclient.samples.list( q=query_samples, limit=1 ) )
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ceilometerclient/v2/samples.py", line 49, in list
    return self._list(options.build_url(path, q, params))

    resp = self.api.get(url)

    raise exceptions.from_response(resp, method, url)

-------

== Solution to problem #1 [3/06/2017]
A new class responsible for interacting with the Ceilometer's API and using the `requests` Python library has been written from scratch.

== Problem #2 [5/06/2017] (FIXED)
The format of the input file with queries has a convoluted formatting and only supports the "=" operator for now.

== Solution to problem #2 [10/06/2017]
This file is no longer needed due to the recent re-design of the tester.

== Problem #3 [5/06/2017] (FIXED)
The file with queries can't have an empty "queries" column, as the current code always breaks the input line into a 3-object tuple:

-------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "show_billable_resources.py", line 46, in <module>
    main()
  File "show_billable_resources.py", line 35, in main
    (meter_name, limit, query_params) = line.strip().split('\t')
ValueError: need more than 2 values to unpack
-------
A workaround for this bug is to always add a parameter like `project_id` to the "queries" column.

== Solution to the problem #3 [10/06/2017]
User no longer needs to specify queries - only list meters, so this file is no longer needed.

== Problem #4 [10/06/2017]
Sending the hashed user token (SHA1) with the headers returns 401 (Unauthorised).
